It is stored in our mind and can be useful in the short term.</p><p>Due to iOS system restrictions, the application cannot collect clipboard history data when running in the background. Therefore, we need a place to quickly save and organize temporary content shared by copying and pasting. Combining this feature with clipboard history management, it becomes “Short-term Memory.”</p><p>Hence, making it convenient for users to put clipboard content into “Short-term Memory” has always been one of the directions in which this feature has been sought.</p><h2 id="basic-usage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basic-usage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Basic Usage</h2><h3 id="long-press-short-term-memory-entry" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#long-press-short-term-memory-entry" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Long-press Short-term Memory Entry</h3><p>Provides options to copy, toggle star, and save as memo.</p><h3 id="swipe-left-to-delete" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#swipe-left-to-delete" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Swipe Left to Delete</h3><p>Swipe left on the short-term memory record to delete it.</p><h3 id="swipe-right-to-star" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#swipe-right-to-star" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Swipe Right to Star</h3><p>Swipe right on the short-term memory record to add a star icon.
