It can be your home, or the route you take to work every day. This familiar place becomes your guide for storing and retrieving any information.</p><p>As we continuously input short-term memories, we need anchors (familiar places) to connect these memories. Anything that conforms to this anchor rule can be stored.</p><p>When we need them, we can find the memories that were once related by following these anchors.</p><p>The concept of Memory Palace used in this app borrows from the “Memory Palace” memory method, where each room is a guide for storing and retrieving any information. The app uses custom rules (regular expressions, etc.) as the entry to retrieve short-term memory, while the &quot;Memory Palace&quot; memory method requires you to assign positions and meanings to each object in the room.</p><p>If you feel that this is inappropriate use of the Memory Palace, you can rename it to &quot;Intelligent Grouping&quot; in the settings.</p><h2 id="basic-usage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#basic-usage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Basic Usage</h2><h3 id="entrance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#entrance" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Entrance</h3><p>The button in the upper-right corner after entering &quot;Short-term Memory&quot;.</p><h3 id="editing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#editing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Editing</h3><p>The edit button in the upper-right corner quickly enters the mode for editing lists and allows you to quickly adjust their order.</p><h3 id="creation" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#creation" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Creation</h3><h4 id="single-click-on-the-icon" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#single-click-on-the-icon" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Single click on the <code>+</code> icon</h4><p>Enter the group creation page and enter the group name and the filtering regular expression.</p><p>If you are not familiar with regular expressions, you can ask in the group or contact me directly.</p><h4 id="long-click-on-the-icon" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#long-click-on-the-icon" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Long click on the <code>+</code> icon</h4><p>Two preset groups, “Website” and “Email,” appear.</p><p>After creation, any content that matches the format of a URL (email) that appears in short-term memory will be automatically associated with this group.</p><h3 id="swipe-left-action" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#swipe-left-action" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Swipe left action</h3><p>“Delete” will delete the current group and its association with short-term memory.</p><p>“Edit” goes to the group editing page, where you can edit the group name and filtering rules, among other properties.</p><h2 id="group-details" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#group-details" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Group Details</h2><p>Displays all short-term memory associated with this group, and allows you to operate on the memory or cancel associations.</p><h3 id="edit-button" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#edit-button" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Edit button</h3><p>Navigates to the group editing page, where you can edit the group name and filtering rules, among other properties.</p><h3 id="automatic-association" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#automatic-association" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Automatic Association</h3><p>Automatically associates short-term memories that meet the filtering rules with this group and puts them in the group.</p><h3 id="clear" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#clear" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Clear</h3><p>Clears the association between short-term memory and this group.
